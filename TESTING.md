### Testing Plan

Testing Plan:

For each change/bug resolved, test the feature to ensure working as expected. Test other developed features to ensure no changes

Once main development finished, the following testing should be done.

#### Manual testing will cover the following
  
- Run Functionality/feature tests
- Each feature is tested per plan. Feature, expectation, testing and results are noted.
- Negative and positive cases to be tested
- Tests to be run for each feature on the site. Each will be tested for 3 user types. Logged-out/logged-in/admin.
- If a bug is encountered, work is done to resolve. Noted in bugs section. And testing cycle to start at beginning.
- Check responsiveness for screen sizes
- Do the user story testing. Review each goal of users. Note how this is achieved. Issues noted
- Review already resolved bugs and test again.

#### Non-manual testing

Run code through

- validators
- lighthouse
- WAVE extension

Validation of code re-checked each time a change made, after the main development completed. <br>
If issues occur, resolve and re-run validation tests. <br>
Wave tests help identify issues early so that they could be corrected and feature/functions re-tested.

- Validate css, html and javascript.
- Lighthouse reports
- WAVE accessibility reports
- Cross brower testing

### Compatibility Testing

- Site was manually tested on google chrome,microsoft edge, firefox and opera. No issues.

- I have access to IE10. Site has limited functionaility as site uses ES6. Recommended to use Microsoft edge rather than IE for best viewing experience
Recommended do not use IE10 to view site, please use Microsoft edge for best viewing experience
