                    <p>For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and eyes strangely bright. He
                        was
                        dimly conscious that entirely fresh influences were at work within him. Yet they seemed to him
                        to have
                        come really from himself. The few words that Basil's friend had said to him--words spoken by
                        chance, no
                        doubt, and with wilful paradox in them--had touched some secret chord that had never been
                        touched
                        before, but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.</p>

                    <p>Music had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But music was not articulate.
                        It was
                        not a new world, but rather another chaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How
                        terrible they
                        were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle
                        magic there
                        was in them! They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a
                        music of
                        their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything so real as words?
                    </p>

                    <p>Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood. He understood them now.
                        Life
                        suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. It seemed to him that he had been walking in fire. Why
                        had he not
                        known it?</p>

                    <p>With his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him. He knew the precise psychological moment when to
                        say
                        nothing. He felt intensely interested. He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had
                        produced, and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, a book which had
                        revealed to him
                        much that he had not known before, he wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar
                        experience. He had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How fascinating the
                        lad was!
